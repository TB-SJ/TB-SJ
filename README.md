👋 Hi, I’m @TB-SJ

👀 I’m interested in applied machine learning, image classification, and using data to solve real-world problems across any industry.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack data science through Springboard, fine-tuning deep learning models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, and exploring ways to improve model generalization across datasets.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source ML projects, computer vision applications, or tools that support non-profits, mentoring programs, or continued education.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve helped companies across dozens of industries bring industrial 3D printing to life — now I’m doing the same with data!
